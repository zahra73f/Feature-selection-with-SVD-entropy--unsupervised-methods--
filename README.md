# Feature-selection-with-SVD-entropy--unsupervised-methods--
feature selection based on SVD rntropy in unsupervised approach

## Problem Description

Many approaches have been developed for dimensionality reduction. In an unsupervised scheme, we mainly try to find a subset that can capture the inherent ‘‘structure’’ of the 
data, such as the neighborhood relation or the cluster structure. In this work, we first study a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based unsupervised feature selection approach proposed by Varshavsky et al. Then we propose a modification of this method to improve its 
performance. 

## Algorithms

All the solutions are designed base on the algorithms as explained in [Feature selection with SVD entropy: Some modification and extension](./article.pdf).

## Results
All results (indexes of selected features in different size-0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5 of all features-) are presented in **Result** folder.
for achieving accuracy with the selected features run the python code accuracy.py that is located in Result folder.
results for each dataset based on 30 percent are as follow:
